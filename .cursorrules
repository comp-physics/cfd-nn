# Cursor Rules for CFD-NN Project

## Testing Requirements

### Physics Validation Tests

The test suite now includes comprehensive physics-based tests to verify the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver:

1. **Divergence-Free Constraint** (`test_solver.cpp`)
   - Verifies ∇·u ≈ 0 (incompressibility)
   - Checks both max and RMS divergence
   - Ensures pressure-velocity coupling works correctly

2. **Mass Conservation** (`test_solver.cpp`)
   - Verifies mass flux conservation through periodic boundaries
   - Tests over multiple time steps
   - Ensures no numerical mass loss/gain

3. **Momentum Balance** (`test_solver.cpp`)
   - Validates dp/dx = ν ∇²u for Poiseuille flow
   - Checks momentum equation is satisfied
   - Verifies viscous stress calculation

4. **Energy Dissipation** (`test_solver.cpp`)
   - Validates energy input = energy dissipation at steady state
   - Tests thermodynamic consistency
   - Ensures proper viscous dissipation

These tests verify the solver obeys fundamental physics, not just numerical convergence.

### CRITICAL: Pre-Push Testing Protocol

**BEFORE EVERY PUSH TO REPOSITORY:**

1. **Run the pre-CI test script:**
 ```bash
 ./test_before_ci.sh
 ```
 This script MUST pass before pushing. It tests:
 - Debug build (like CI does)
 - Release build (like CI does)
 - All unit tests in both configurations
 - Checks for compiler warnings

2. **For GPU-related changes, ALSO run:**
 ```bash
 ./test_before_ci_gpu.sh
 ```
 This runs the COMPLETE GPU CI test suite locally:
 - All unit tests on GPU (including physics validation tests)
 - Fast turbulence model validation (Baseline, GEP, SST, k-omega, EARSM)
 - Periodic Hills complex geometry tests
 - CPU/GPU consistency validation
 - Takes 10-15 minutes and ensures GPU CI will pass

3. **Why this matters:**
 - CPU CI runs 4 configurations: (Ubuntu + macOS) × (Debug + Release)
 - GPU CI runs comprehensive physics validation on actual GPU hardware
 - Local development often only tests one configuration
 - Debug builds have different behavior than Release
 - Tests that pass locally in Release may fail in CI's Debug build
 - GPU tests that work on small problems may fail on large-scale runs

### Test Development Guidelines

1. **No Platform-Specific Tolerances**
   - DO NOT add `#ifdef __APPLE__` or similar platform checks
   - DO NOT relax tolerances for different compilers
   - If a test is numerically sensitive, fix the root cause, don't hide it

2. **Build-Type Independence**
   - Tests should pass in BOTH Debug and Release builds
   - If different behavior is needed, it's a code smell - investigate why

3. **Numerical Robustness**
   - Avoid overly strict floating-point comparisons (e.g., `==` for doubles)
   - Use appropriate tolerances based on algorithm, not platform
   - For iterative solvers: check residual convergence, not exact iteration count

4. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test should be independent
   - Don't rely on execution order
   - Clean up any state/files created during tests

### Common CI Failure Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Bad: Tests that only pass in Release**
```cpp
// This might fail in Debug due to different optimization
assert(iterations < 100);  // Iteration count is optimization-dependent!
```

✅ **Good: Tests that work in both Debug and Release**
```cpp
// Check convergence, not iteration count
assert(residual < tolerance);
assert(std::isfinite(result));
```

❌ **Bad: Missing body force setup**
```cpp
RANSSolver solver(mesh, config);
// Forgot to set body force - flow won't develop!
solver.step();
```

✅ **Good: Complete initialization**
```cpp
RANSSolver solver(mesh, config);
solver.set_body_force(-config.dp_dx, 0.0);
solver.initialize_uniform(0.1, 0.0);
solver.step();
```

❌ **Bad: Exact floating-point comparisons**
```cpp
assert(max_u == 1.0);  // Will fail due to numerical precision
```

✅ **Good: Tolerance-based comparisons**
```cpp
assert(std::abs(max_u - 1.0) < 1e-10);
```

### Code Quality Standards

1. **No Compiler Warnings**
   - Fix ALL warnings before pushing
   - Use `[[maybe_unused]]` for intentionally unused variables in assertions
   - Don't suppress warnings with flags

2. **Const Correctness**
   - Use `const` for read-only references
   - Mark methods `const` if they don't modify state

3. **RAII for Resource Management**
   - Use smart pointers or RAII wrappers
   - No manual `new`/`delete` or `malloc`/`free`
   - GPU buffers use `OmpDeviceBuffer` wrapper

4. **Error Handling**
   - Check return values
   - Use exceptions for error conditions
   - Provide informative error messages

### Performance Guidelines

1. **Data Movement (CPU-GPU)**
   - Minimize CPU↔GPU transfers
   - Keep frequently accessed data on GPU
   - Batch operations when possible

2. **Algorithmic Choices**
   - Profile before optimizing
   - Document complexity assumptions
   - Use appropriate data structures

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Public API Documentation**
   - Every public function needs a comment
   - Explain parameters, return values, side effects
   - Include usage examples for complex functions

2. **Code Comments**
   - Explain WHY, not WHAT
   - Document numerical algorithms
   - Note any non-obvious optimizations

3. **README Updates**
   - Keep command-line options up to date
   - Document new features
   - Update examples when behavior changes

## Workflow Best Practices

### Before Starting Work
1. Pull latest changes from main
2. Create feature branch
3. Run `./test_before_ci.sh` to verify starting state

### During Development
1. Build and test frequently
2. Test in Debug mode during development
3. Fix warnings immediately (don't accumulate)

### Before Committing
1. Run all tests: `cd build && ctest`
2. Check for warnings: Review build output
3. Verify changes don't break existing functionality

### Before Pushing
1. **MANDATORY**: Run `./test_before_ci.sh`
2. Only push if script passes completely
3. If it fails, fix issues before pushing

### After Pushing
1. Monitor CI status on GitHub
2. If CI fails, fix immediately (don't push more changes on top)
3. Learn from CI failures to prevent similar issues

## Git Commit Guidelines

1. **Descriptive Messages**
   - First line: Brief summary (<50 chars)
   - Blank line
   - Detailed explanation if needed

2. **Atomic Commits**
   - One logical change per commit
   - Don't mix refactoring with feature additions
   - Each commit should leave code in working state

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update tests when changing behavior
   - Don't commit broken tests

## File Organization

- `/src/` - Implementation files
- `/include/` - Header files (public API)
- `/app/` - Application entry points
- `/tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `/data/models/` - Neural network model files
- `/output/` - Generated output (VTK, data files)
- `/scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `/docs/` - Documentation

## Common Gotchas

1. **Solver Initialization**
   - Always call `set_body_force()` for driven flows
   - Initialize velocity field before solving
   - Set turbulence model before first step

2. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Ensure BCs are consistent across solver components
   - Periodic BCs require special handling in Poisson solver

3. **GPU Offload**
   - Data must be explicitly uploaded to GPU
   - Check `USE_GPU_OFFLOAD` is defined
   - Verify `omp_get_num_devices() > 0` at runtime

4. **VTK Output**
   - Use `solve_steady_with_snapshots()` for automatic output
   - Specify `num_snapshots` in config
   - Files are numbered sequentially + final

## Quick Reference

**Run tests locally (like CI):**
```bash
./test_before_ci.sh
```

**Build for debugging:**
```bash
mkdir -p build_debug && cd build_debug
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make -j4
ctest --output-on-failure
```

**Build for performance:**
```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

**Check for warnings:**
```bash
cd build
make clean
make 2>&1 | grep -i "warning:"
```

**Run single test:**
```bash
cd build
./test_solver
```

**Run with verbose output:**
```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure --verbose
```

## Emergency: CI is Failing

1. **Check which configuration failed:**
   - Ubuntu Debug? Ubuntu Release?
   - macOS Debug? macOS Release?

2. **Reproduce locally:**
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu Debug failure:
   ./test_before_ci.sh
   # Check Debug output specifically
   ```

3. **Common fixes:**
   - Missing initialization (body force, etc.)
   - Unused variables in assertions (use `[[maybe_unused]]`)
   - Platform paths (use relative paths)
   - Missing `#include` that worked locally

4. **Don't:**
   - Push "fixes" without running `test_before_ci.sh`
   - Add platform-specific workarounds
   - Disable failing tests
   - Relax tolerances to hide issues

---

Remember: **CI failures are usually legitimate bugs or test issues, not platform quirks.**
Fix the root cause, don't work around it!
