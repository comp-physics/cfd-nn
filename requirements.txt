# Python dependencies for training neural network turbulence models
#
# Install with:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: The CFD solver itself has NO Python dependencies.
# These are only needed for training NN models offline.

# Core ML framework (choose one):
torch>=1.10.0              # PyTorch for training TBNN/MLP models

# Data processing
numpy>=1.20.0
pandas>=1.3.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# Dataset download
kaggle>=1.5.12             # For downloading McConkey dataset

# Visualization (optional)
matplotlib>=3.4.0

# Export tools (optional - for TensorFlow models)
# tensorflow>=2.8.0        # Uncomment if exporting from TensorFlow
