# Turbulent Channel - Baseline (Mixing Length) Model

@include config_base.cfg

# Turbulence model
model = baseline

# Baseline model uses mixing length with van Driest damping
# nu_t = (kappa*y)^2 * |S| * (1 - exp(-y+/A+))
# This is a simple algebraic model - no transport equations

# Expected: Reasonable prediction of mean velocity profile
# but cannot capture all turbulence physics
