# Turbulent Channel - Neural Network MLP Model

@include config_base.cfg

# Turbulence model
model = nn_mlp

# Neural network model - scalar eddy viscosity
# Predicts nu_t directly from flow features

# Preset model (uses example weights if not trained)
nn_preset = example_scalar_nut

# NOTE: For real results, train your own model:
#   python scripts/train_mlp_mcconkey.py --case channel --output data/models/mlp_channel
# Then use: nn_preset = mlp_channel

# Expected with real weights: Best scalar eddy viscosity prediction
# Expected with example weights: Random (not physically meaningful)
