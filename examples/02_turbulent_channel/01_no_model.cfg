# Turbulent Channel - NO turbulence model (will underpredict)
# This demonstrates why turbulence modeling is needed!

# Include base settings
@include config_base.cfg

# Turbulence model
turb_model = none

# Note: Without a turbulence model, the solver will predict laminar-like flow
# even though Re is high. This is expected and shows the importance of modeling!
