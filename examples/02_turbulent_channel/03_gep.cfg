# Turbulent Channel - GEP (Gene Expression Programming) Model

@include config_base.cfg

# Turbulence model
turb_model = gep

# GEP model uses algebraic expressions discovered via genetic programming
# Based on Weatheritt & Sandberg (2016)
# More sophisticated than mixing length, still algebraic (fast!)

# Expected: Better prediction than baseline, especially in complex regions
# No neural network weights needed - pure formulas
