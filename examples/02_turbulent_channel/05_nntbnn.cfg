# Turbulent Channel - Neural Network TBNN Model

@include config_base.cfg

# Turbulence model
model = nn_tbnn

# TBNN (Tensor Basis Neural Network)
# Predicts anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor
# Most sophisticated model - frame-invariant predictions

# Preset model (uses example weights if not trained)
nn_preset = example_tbnn

# NOTE: For real results, train your own model:
#   python scripts/train_tbnn_mcconkey.py --case channel --output data/models/tbnn_channel
# Then use: nn_preset = tbnn_channel

# Expected with real weights: Best overall prediction, captures anisotropy
# Expected with example weights: Random (not physically meaningful)
