priority: 10

DEBUGGING RULE
- Never request full logs. Use packets only.
- Do not proceed with diagnosis until the relevant packet output is provided.

RESULT PACKET (ask for only this)
1) Exact command
2) Where it ran (OS/arch + compiler/runtime versions if relevant)
3) Exit status (code/signal)
4) First error block + <= 40 lines context
5) Tail: stderr <= 120 lines, stdout <= 80 lines
6) File:line references

PREFERRED COMMANDS
- GitHub CI: run `./tools/ci_packet.sh <runid>` via terminal tool (if <runid> missing, run `./tools/ci_packet.sh`).
- SLURM: run `./tools/spkt <JOBID>` via terminal tool (if <JOBID> missing, run `./tools/spkt`).
- Local: run `./tools/local_packet.sh <command...>` via terminal tool.

If terminal execution is unavailable or blocked by approvals, ask for approval or ask me to run the single command.

OUTPUT
- Patch/diff first.
- If more info is needed: ask for ONE additional item only.
