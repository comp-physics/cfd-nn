GOAL
- Minimal token usage and minimal code churn.

SCOPE
- Do NOT scan the entire repository.
- Default to <= 3 files and <= 200 LOC touched.
- If more is needed, STOP and ask with proposed file list + why (<= 4 bullets).

OUTPUT
- Default output: unified diff only.
- If text is needed: <= 4 bullets, 1 sentence each.
- Do NOT create new markdown/doc files unless explicitly asked.
- Always submit slurm jobs using the embers QOS

BEHAVIOR
- When unsure, ask 1 targeted question instead of exploring widely.
- Keep existing style/conventions; no large renames/reformats unless asked.
